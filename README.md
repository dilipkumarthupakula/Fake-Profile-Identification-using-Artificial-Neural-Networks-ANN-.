# Fake-Profile-Identification-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks-ANN-.
**Project Summary:** 
    Fake Profile Identification Using Artificial Neural Networks. Led the full-cycle de-velopment of a deep learning solution (Multi-Layer Perceptron) using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to classify fraudulent social media profiles. The core methodology involved extensive data preprocessing and sophisticated feature engineering based on over 15 distinct profile attributes (e.g., activity metrics and network features). I was responsible for model training, optimization, and achieving a high classification accuracy of project’s final accuracy 95. This project demonstrated expertise in applying advanced AI/ML techniques to solve critical, real-world cybersecurity challenge related to platform integrity and user safety.
